    Retiring: 21.0% of Pipeline Slots
        Light Operations: 19.4% of Pipeline Slots
        Heavy Operations: 1.6% of Pipeline Slots
            Microcode Sequencer: 1.6% of Pipeline Slots
                Assists: 0.0% of Pipeline Slots
                CISC: 1.6% of Pipeline Slots
    Front-End Bound: 18.2% of Pipeline Slots
     | Issue: A significant portion of Pipeline Slots is remaining empty due to
     | issues in the Front-End.
     | 
     | Tips:  Make sure the code working size is not too large, the code layout
     | does not require too many memory accesses per cycle to get enough
     | instructions for filling four pipeline slots, or check for microcode
     | assists.
     |
        Front-End Latency: 16.2% of Pipeline Slots
         | This metric represents a fraction of slots during which CPU was
         | stalled due to front-end latency issues, such as instruction-cache
         | misses, ITLB misses or fetch stalls after a branch misprediction. In
         | such cases, the front-end delivers no uOps.
         |
            ICache Misses: 8.1% of Clockticks
             | Issue: A significant portion of instruction fetches is missing in
             | the instruction cache.
             | 
             | Tips:
             | 
             | 1. Use profile-guided optimization to reduce the size of hot code
             | regions.
             | 
             | 2. Consider compiler options to reorder functions so that hot
             | functions are located together.
             | 
             | 3. If your application makes significant use of macros, try to
             | reduce this by either converting the relevant macros to functions
             | or using linker options to eliminate repeated code.
             | 
             | 4. Consider the Os/O1 optimization level or the following subset
             | of optimizations to decrease your code footprint:
             |     - use inlining only when it decreases the footprint
             |     - disable loop unrolling
             |     - disable intrinsic inlining
             |

    Bad Speculation: 6.3% of Pipeline Slots
        Branch Mispredict: 0.0% of Pipeline Slots
        Machine Clears: 6.3% of Pipeline Slots
    Back-End Bound: 54.5% of Pipeline Slots
     | A significant portion of pipeline slots are remaining empty. When
     | operations take too long in the back-end, they introduce bubbles in the
     | pipeline that ultimately cause fewer pipeline slots containing useful
     | work to be retired per cycle than the machine is capable to support. This
     | opportunity cost results in slower execution. Long-latency operations
     | like divides and memory operations can cause this, as can too many
     | operations being directed to a single execution port (for example, more
     | multiply operations arriving in the back-end per cycle than the execution
     | unit can support).
     |
        Memory Bound: 54.5% of Pipeline Slots
         | The metric value is high. This can indicate that the significant
         | fraction of execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand
         | memory load and stores. Use Memory Access analysis to have the metric
         | breakdown by memory hierarchy, memory bandwidth information,
         | correlation by memory objects.
         |
            L1 Bound: 24.3% of Clockticks
             | This metric shows how often machine was stalled without missing
             | the L1 data cache. The L1 cache typically has the shortest
             | latency. However, in certain cases like loads blocked on older
             | stores, a load might suffer a high latency even though it is
             | being satisfied by the L1. Note that this metric value may be
             | highlighted due to DTLB Overhead or Cycles of 1 Port Utilized
             | issues.
             |
                DTLB Overhead: 0.0% of Clockticks
                Loads Blocked by Store Forwarding: 0.0% of Clockticks
                Lock Latency: 0.0% of Clockticks
                 | A significant fraction of CPU cycles spent handling cache
                 | misses due to lock operations. Due to the microarchitecture
                 | handling of locks, they are classified as L1 Bound regardless
                 | of what memory source satisfied them. Note that this metric
                 | value may be highlighted due to Store Latency issue.
                 |
                Split Loads: 0.0% of Clockticks
                4K Aliasing: 0.0% of Clockticks
                FB Full: 0.0% of Clockticks
                 | This metric does a rough estimation of how often L1D Fill
                 | Buffer unavailability limited additional L1D miss memory
                 | access requests to proceed. The higher the metric value, the
                 | deeper the memory hierarchy level the misses are satisfied
                 | from. Often it hints on approaching bandwidth limits (to L2
                 | cache, L3 cache or external memory). Avoid adding software
                 | prefetches if indeed memory BW limited.
                 |
            L2 Bound: 8.1% of Clockticks
             | This metric shows how often machine was stalled on L2 cache.
             | Avoiding cache misses (L1 misses/L2 hits) will improve the
             | latency and increase performance.
