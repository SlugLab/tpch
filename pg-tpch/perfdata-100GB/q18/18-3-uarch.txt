     | Issue: A significant portion of Pipeline Slots is remaining empty due to

     | 
     | Tips:  Make sure the code working size is not too large, the code layout

        Front-End Latency: 9.1% of Pipeline Slots

        Front-End Bandwidth: 11.4% of Pipeline Slots
         | This metric represents a fraction of slots during which CPU was
         | stalled due to front-end bandwidth issues, such as inefficiencies in
         | the instruction decoders or code restrictions for caching in the DSB
         | (decoded uOps cache). In such cases, the front-end typically delivers
         | a non-optimal amount of uOps to the back-end.
         |
            Front-End Bandwidth MITE: 12.9% of Pipeline Slots
             | This metric represents a fraction of cycles during which CPU was
             | stalled due to the MITE fetch pipeline issues, such as
             | inefficiencies in the instruction decoders.
             |
            Front-End Bandwidth DSB: 3.6% of Pipeline Slots
            (Info) DSB Coverage: 40.0%
             | Issue: A significant fraction of uOps was not delivered by the
             | DSB (known as Decoded ICache or uOp Cache). This may happen if a
             | hot code region is too large to fit into the DSB.
             | 
             | Tips: Consider changing the code layout (for example, via
             | profile-guided optimization) to help your hot regions fit into
             | the DSB.
             |

    Bad Speculation: 3.4% of Pipeline Slots
        Branch Mispredict: 3.4% of Pipeline Slots
        Machine Clears: 0.0% of Pipeline Slots
    Back-End Bound: 37.0% of Pipeline Slots
     | A significant portion of pipeline slots are remaining empty. When
     | operations take too long in the back-end, they introduce bubbles in the
     | pipeline that ultimately cause fewer pipeline slots containing useful
     | work to be retired per cycle than the machine is capable to support. This
     | opportunity cost results in slower execution. Long-latency operations
     | like divides and memory operations can cause this, as can too many
     | operations being directed to a single execution port (for example, more
     | multiply operations arriving in the back-end per cycle than the execution
     | unit can support).
     |
        Memory Bound: 25.8% of Pipeline Slots
         | The metric value is high. This can indicate that the significant
         | fraction of execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand
         | memory load and stores. Use Memory Access analysis to have the metric
         | breakdown by memory hierarchy, memory bandwidth information,
         | correlation by memory objects.

            DRAM Bound: 15.8% of Clockticks
             | This metric shows how often CPU was stalled on the main memory
             | (DRAM). Caching typically improves the latency and increases
             | performance.
             |
                Memory Bandwidth: 1.4% of Clockticks
                 | Issue: A significant fraction of cycles was stalled due to
                 | approaching bandwidth limits of the main memory (DRAM).
                 | 
                 | Tips: Improve data accesses to reduce cacheline transfers
                 | from/to memory using these possible techniques:
                 |     - Consume all bytes of each cacheline before it is
                 |       evicted (for example, reorder structure elements and
                 |       split non-hot ones).
                 |     - Merge compute-limited and bandwidth-limited loops.
                 |     - Use NUMA optimizations on a multi-socket system.
                 | 
                 | Note: software prefetches do not help a bandwidth-limited
                 | application.
                 |
                Memory Latency: 56.1% of Clockticks
                 | Issue: A significant fraction of cycles was stalled due to
                 | the latency of the main memory (DRAM).
                 | 
                 | Tips: Improve data accesses or interleave them with compute
                 | using such possible techniques as data layout re-structuring
                 | or software prefetches (through the compiler).
                 |
                    Local DRAM: 2.5% of Clockticks
                    Remote DRAM: 0.0% of Clockticks
                    Remote Cache: 0.0% of Clockticks
            Store Bound: 22.1% of Clockticks
             | Issue: CPU was stalled on store operations for a significant
             | fraction of cycles.
             | 
             | Tips: Consider False Sharing analysis as your next step.
             |
                Store Latency: 23.7% of Clockticks
                 | This metric represents a fraction of cycles the CPU spent
                 | handling long-latency store misses (missing the 2nd level
                 | cache). Consider avoiding/reducing unnecessary (or easily
                 | loadable/computable) memory store. Note that this metric
                 | value may be highlighted due to a Lock Latency issue.
                 |
                False Sharing: 0.0% of Clockticks
                Split Stores: 0.0% of Clockticks
                DTLB Store Overhead: 1.8% of Clockticks
        Core Bound: 11.2% of Pipeline Slots
         | This metric represents how much Core non-memory issues were of a
         | bottleneck. Shortage in hardware compute resources, or dependencies
         | software's instructions are both categorized under Core Bound. Hence
         | it may indicate the machine ran out of an OOO resources, certain
         | execution units are overloaded or dependencies in program's data- or
         | instruction- flow are limiting the performance (e.g. FP-chained long-
         | latency arithmetic operations).
         |
            Divider: 0.0% of Clockticks
            Port Utilization: 22.1% of Clockticks
             | Issue: A significant fraction of cycles was stalled due to Core
             | non-divider-related issues.
             | 
             | Tips: Use vectorization to reduce pressure on the execution ports
             | as multiple elements are calculated with same uOp.
             |
                Cycles of 0 Ports Utilized: 39.8% of Clockticks
                 | CPU executed no uOps on any execution port during a
                 | significant fraction of cycles. Long-latency instructions
                 | like divides may contribute to this issue. Check the Assembly
                 | view and Appendix C in the Optimization Guide to identify
                 | instructions with 5 or more cycles latency.
