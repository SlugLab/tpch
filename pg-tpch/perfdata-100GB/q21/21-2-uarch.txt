            Microcode Sequencer: 1.9% of Pipeline Slots
                Assists: 0.0% of Pipeline Slots
                CISC: 1.9% of Pipeline Slots
    Front-End Bound: 22.3% of Pipeline Slots
     | Issue: A significant portion of Pipeline Slots is remaining empty due to
     | issues in the Front-End.
     | 
     | Tips:  Make sure the code working size is not too large, the code layout
     | does not require too many memory accesses per cycle to get enough
     | instructions for filling four pipeline slots, or check for microcode
     | assists.
     |
        Front-End Latency: 11.0% of Pipeline Slots
         | This metric represents a fraction of slots during which CPU was
         | stalled due to front-end latency issues, such as instruction-cache
         | misses, ITLB misses or fetch stalls after a branch misprediction. In
         | such cases, the front-end delivers no uOps.
         |
            ICache Misses: 1.3% of Clockticks
            ITLB Overhead: 0.5% of Clockticks
            Branch Resteers: 1.9% of Clockticks
            DSB Switches: 2.6% of Clockticks
             | Issue: A significant portion of cycles is spent switching from
             | the DSB to the MITE.  This may happen if a hot code region is too
             | large to fit into the DSB.
             | 
             | Tips: Consider changing code layout (for example, via profile-
             | guided optimization) to help your hot regions fit into the DSB.
             |

            Length Changing Prefixes: 0.0% of Clockticks
             | Issue: A significant fraction of cycles was stalled due to Length
             | Changing Prefixes (LCPs).
             | 
             | Tips: To avoid this issue, use proper compiler flags. Intel
             | Compiler enables these flags by default.
             |

        Front-End Bandwidth: 11.3% of Pipeline Slots
         | This metric represents a fraction of slots during which CPU was
         | stalled due to front-end bandwidth issues, such as inefficiencies in
         | the instruction decoders or code restrictions for caching in the DSB
         | (decoded uOps cache). In such cases, the front-end typically delivers
         | a non-optimal amount of uOps to the back-end.
         |
            Front-End Bandwidth MITE: 13.6% of Pipeline Slots
             | This metric represents a fraction of cycles during which CPU was
             | stalled due to the MITE fetch pipeline issues, such as
             | inefficiencies in the instruction decoders.
             |
            Front-End Bandwidth DSB: 5.8% of Pipeline Slots
            (Info) DSB Coverage: 49.1%
             | Issue: A significant fraction of uOps was not delivered by the
             | DSB (known as Decoded ICache or uOp Cache). This may happen if a
             | hot code region is too large to fit into the DSB.
             | 
             | Tips: Consider changing the code layout (for example, via

    Bad Speculation: 0.5% of Pipeline Slots
        Branch Mispredict: 0.0% of Pipeline Slots
        Machine Clears: 0.5% of Pipeline Slots
    Back-End Bound: 32.9% of Pipeline Slots
     | A significant portion of pipeline slots are remaining empty. When
     | operations take too long in the back-end, they introduce bubbles in the
     | pipeline that ultimately cause fewer pipeline slots containing useful
     | work to be retired per cycle than the machine is capable to support. This
     | opportunity cost results in slower execution. Long-latency operations
     | like divides and memory operations can cause this, as can too many
     | operations being directed to a single execution port (for example, more
     | multiply operations arriving in the back-end per cycle than the execution
     | unit can support).
     |
        Memory Bound: 25.3% of Pipeline Slots
         | The metric value is high. This can indicate that the significant
         | fraction of execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand
         | memory load and stores. Use Memory Access analysis to have the metric
         | breakdown by memory hierarchy, memory bandwidth information,
         | correlation by memory objects.

            DRAM Bound: 11.6% of Clockticks
             | This metric shows how often CPU was stalled on the main memory
             | (DRAM). Caching typically improves the latency and increases
             | performance.
             |
                Memory Bandwidth: 2.0% of Clockticks
                 | Issue: A significant fraction of cycles was stalled due to
                 | approaching bandwidth limits of the main memory (DRAM).
                 | 
                 | Tips: Improve data accesses to reduce cacheline transfers
                 | from/to memory using these possible techniques:
                 |     - Consume all bytes of each cacheline before it is
                 |       evicted (for example, reorder structure elements and
                 |       split non-hot ones).
                 |     - Merge compute-limited and bandwidth-limited loops.
                 |     - Use NUMA optimizations on a multi-socket system.
                 | 
                 | Note: software prefetches do not help a bandwidth-limited
                 | application.
                 |
                Memory Latency: 61.3% of Clockticks
                 | Issue: A significant fraction of cycles was stalled due to
                 | the latency of the main memory (DRAM).
                 | 
                 | Tips: Improve data accesses or interleave them with compute
                 | using such possible techniques as data layout re-structuring
                 | or software prefetches (through the compiler).
