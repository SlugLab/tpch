     | A significant portion of pipeline slots are remaining empty. When
     | operations take too long in the back-end, they introduce bubbles in the
     | pipeline that ultimately cause fewer pipeline slots containing useful
     | work to be retired per cycle than the machine is capable to support. This
     | opportunity cost results in slower execution. Long-latency operations
     | like divides and memory operations can cause this, as can too many
     | operations being directed to a single execution port (for example, more
     | multiply operations arriving in the back-end per cycle than the execution

             | This metric shows how often machine was stalled without missing
             | the L1 data cache. The L1 cache typically has the shortest
             | latency. However, in certain cases like loads blocked on older
             | stores, a load might suffer a high latency even though it is
             | being satisfied by the L1. Note that this metric value may be

                 | A significant fraction of CPU cycles spent handling cache
                 | misses due to lock operations. Due to the microarchitecture
                 | handling of locks, they are classified as L1 Bound regardless

                 | Buffer unavailability limited additional L1D miss memory
                 | access requests to proceed. The higher the metric value, the
                 | deeper the memory hierarchy level the misses are satisfied
                 | from. Often it hints on approaching bandwidth limits (to L2
                 | cache, L3 cache or external memory). Avoid adding software
                 | prefetches if indeed memory BW limited.

                 | (possibly L3 latency limited). Avoiding private cache misses

                 | contention with sibling physical cores and increase

             | 
             | Tips: Use vectorization to reduce pressure on the execution ports

                 | This metric represents cycles fraction where the CPU executed

                 | due to heavy data-dependency among software instructions, or
                 | oversubscribing a particular hardware resource. In some other
                 | cases with high 1_Port_Utilized and L1 Bound, this metric can
                 | point to L1 data-cache latency bottleneck that may not
                 | necessarily manifest with complete execution starvation (due
                 | to the short L1 latency e.g. walking a linked list) - looking
