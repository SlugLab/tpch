    Retiring: 27.6% of Pipeline Slots

                CISC: 2.7% of Pipeline Slots
    Front-End Bound: 15.7% of Pipeline Slots
     | Issue: A significant portion of Pipeline Slots is remaining empty due to
     | issues in the Front-End.
     | 
     | Tips:  Make sure the code working size is not too large, the code layout
     | does not require too many memory accesses per cycle to get enough
     | instructions for filling four pipeline slots, or check for microcode
     | assists.

        Branch Mispredict: 2.0% of Pipeline Slots
        Machine Clears: 0.0% of Pipeline Slots
    Back-End Bound: 54.8% of Pipeline Slots
     | A significant portion of pipeline slots are remaining empty. When
     | operations take too long in the back-end, they introduce bubbles in the
     | pipeline that ultimately cause fewer pipeline slots containing useful
     | work to be retired per cycle than the machine is capable to support. This
     | opportunity cost results in slower execution. Long-latency operations
     | like divides and memory operations can cause this, as can too many
     | operations being directed to a single execution port (for example, more
     | multiply operations arriving in the back-end per cycle than the execution
     | unit can support).
     |
        Memory Bound: 31.3% of Pipeline Slots
         | The metric value is high. This can indicate that the significant
         | fraction of execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand
         | memory load and stores. Use Memory Access analysis to have the metric
         | breakdown by memory hierarchy, memory bandwidth information,
         | correlation by memory objects.

            L2 Bound: 3.7% of Clockticks
            L3 Bound: 17.9% of Clockticks
             | This metric shows how often CPU was stalled on L3 cache, or
             | contended with a sibling Core. Avoiding cache misses (L2
             | misses/L3 hits) improves the latency and increases performance.
             |
                Contested Accesses: 0.0% of Clockticks
                Data Sharing: 0.0% of Clockticks
                L3 Latency: 2.7% of Clockticks
                 | This metric shows a fraction of cycles with demand load
                 | accesses that hit the L3 cache under unloaded scenarios
                 | (possibly L3 latency limited). Avoiding private cache misses
                 | (i.e. L2 misses/L3 hits) will improve the latency, reduce
                 | contention with sibling physical cores and increase
                 | performance. Note the value of this node may overlap with its
                 | siblings.

        Core Bound: 23.5% of Pipeline Slots
         | This metric represents how much Core non-memory issues were of a
         | bottleneck. Shortage in hardware compute resources, or dependencies
         | software's instructions are both categorized under Core Bound. Hence
         | it may indicate the machine ran out of an OOO resources, certain
         | execution units are overloaded or dependencies in program's data- or
         | instruction- flow are limiting the performance (e.g. FP-chained long-
         | latency arithmetic operations).
         |
            Divider: 0.0% of Clockticks
            Port Utilization: 31.5% of Clockticks
             | Issue: A significant fraction of cycles was stalled due to Core
             | non-divider-related issues.
             | 
             | Tips: Use vectorization to reduce pressure on the execution ports
             | as multiple elements are calculated with same uOp.
             |

                 | CPU executed no uOps on any execution port during a
                 | significant fraction of cycles. Long-latency instructions
                 | like divides may contribute to this issue. Check the Assembly
                 | view and Appendix C in the Optimization Guide to identify
