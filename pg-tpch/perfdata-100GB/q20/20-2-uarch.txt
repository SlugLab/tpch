        Machine Clears: 0.2% of Pipeline Slots
    Back-End Bound: 72.9% of Pipeline Slots
     | A significant portion of pipeline slots are remaining empty. When
     | operations take too long in the back-end, they introduce bubbles in the
     | pipeline that ultimately cause fewer pipeline slots containing useful
     | work to be retired per cycle than the machine is capable to support. This
     | opportunity cost results in slower execution. Long-latency operations
     | like divides and memory operations can cause this, as can too many
     | operations being directed to a single execution port (for example, more
     | multiply operations arriving in the back-end per cycle than the execution
     | unit can support).
     |
        Memory Bound: 47.2% of Pipeline Slots
         | The metric value is high. This can indicate that the significant
         | fraction of execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand
         | memory load and stores. Use Memory Access analysis to have the metric
         | breakdown by memory hierarchy, memory bandwidth information,
         | correlation by memory objects.
         |
            L1 Bound: 14.9% of Clockticks
             | This metric shows how often machine was stalled without missing
             | the L1 data cache. The L1 cache typically has the shortest
             | latency. However, in certain cases like loads blocked on older
             | stores, a load might suffer a high latency even though it is
             | being satisfied by the L1. Note that this metric value may be
             | highlighted due to DTLB Overhead or Cycles of 1 Port Utilized
             | issues.
             |

                Lock Latency: 0.4% of Clockticks
                 | A significant fraction of CPU cycles spent handling cache
                 | misses due to lock operations. Due to the microarchitecture
                 | handling of locks, they are classified as L1 Bound regardless
                 | of what memory source satisfied them. Note that this metric
                 | value may be highlighted due to Store Latency issue.

                FB Full: 100.0% of Clockticks
                 | This metric does a rough estimation of how often L1D Fill
                 | Buffer unavailability limited additional L1D miss memory
                 | access requests to proceed. The higher the metric value, the
                 | deeper the memory hierarchy level the misses are satisfied
                 | from. Often it hints on approaching bandwidth limits (to L2
                 | cache, L3 cache or external memory). Avoid adding software
                 | prefetches if indeed memory BW limited.
                 |
            L2 Bound: 0.9% of Clockticks
            L3 Bound: 8.9% of Clockticks
             | This metric shows how often CPU was stalled on L3 cache, or
             | contended with a sibling Core. Avoiding cache misses (L2
             | misses/L3 hits) improves the latency and increases performance.

                 | This metric shows a fraction of cycles with demand load
                 | accesses that hit the L3 cache under unloaded scenarios
                 | (possibly L3 latency limited). Avoiding private cache misses
                 | (i.e. L2 misses/L3 hits) will improve the latency, reduce
                 | contention with sibling physical cores and increase
                 | performance. Note the value of this node may overlap with its
                 | siblings.

                SQ Full: 0.5% of Clockticks
                 | This metric measures fraction of cycles where the Super Queue
                 | (SQ) was full taking into account all request-types and both
                 | hardware SMT threads. The Super Queue is used for requests to
                 | access the L2 cache or to go out to the Uncore.
                 |
            DRAM Bound: 18.9% of Clockticks
             | This metric shows how often CPU was stalled on the main memory
             | (DRAM). Caching typically improves the latency and increases
             | performance.
             |
                Memory Bandwidth: 3.3% of Clockticks
                 | Issue: A significant fraction of cycles was stalled due to
                 | approaching bandwidth limits of the main memory (DRAM).
                 | 
                 | Tips: Improve data accesses to reduce cacheline transfers
                 | from/to memory using these possible techniques:
                 |     - Consume all bytes of each cacheline before it is
                 |       evicted (for example, reorder structure elements and
                 |       split non-hot ones).
                 |     - Merge compute-limited and bandwidth-limited loops.
                 |     - Use NUMA optimizations on a multi-socket system.
                 | 
                 | Note: software prefetches do not help a bandwidth-limited
                 | application.
                 |
                Memory Latency: 38.5% of Clockticks
                 | Issue: A significant fraction of cycles was stalled due to
                 | the latency of the main memory (DRAM).
                 | 
                 | Tips: Improve data accesses or interleave them with compute
                 | using such possible techniques as data layout re-structuring
                 | or software prefetches (through the compiler).

        Core Bound: 25.7% of Pipeline Slots
         | This metric represents how much Core non-memory issues were of a
         | bottleneck. Shortage in hardware compute resources, or dependencies
         | software's instructions are both categorized under Core Bound. Hence
         | it may indicate the machine ran out of an OOO resources, certain
         | execution units are overloaded or dependencies in program's data- or
         | instruction- flow are limiting the performance (e.g. FP-chained long-
         | latency arithmetic operations).
         |
            Divider: 0.0% of Clockticks
            Port Utilization: 33.0% of Clockticks
             | Issue: A significant fraction of cycles was stalled due to Core
             | non-divider-related issues.
             | 
             | Tips: Use vectorization to reduce pressure on the execution ports
             | as multiple elements are calculated with same uOp.
             |
                Cycles of 0 Ports Utilized: 65.1% of Clockticks
                 | CPU executed no uOps on any execution port during a
                 | significant fraction of cycles. Long-latency instructions
                 | like divides may contribute to this issue. Check the Assembly
                 | view and Appendix C in the Optimization Guide to identify
                 | instructions with 5 or more cycles latency.
                 |
                Cycles of 1 Port Utilized: 11.4% of Clockticks
                 | This metric represents cycles fraction where the CPU executed
                 | total of 1 uop per cycle on all execution ports. This can be
                 | due to heavy data-dependency among software instructions, or
                 | oversubscribing a particular hardware resource. In some other
                 | cases with high 1_Port_Utilized and L1 Bound, this metric can
                 | point to L1 data-cache latency bottleneck that may not
                 | necessarily manifest with complete execution starvation (due
                 | to the short L1 latency e.g. walking a linked list) - looking
                 | at the assembly can be helpful. Note that this metric value
                 | may be highlighted due to L1 Bound issue.
