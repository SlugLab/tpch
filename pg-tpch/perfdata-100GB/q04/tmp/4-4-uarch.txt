        Machine Clears: 7.5% of Pipeline Slots
    Back-End Bound: 70.2% of Pipeline Slots
     | A significant portion of pipeline slots are remaining empty. When
     | operations take too long in the back-end, they introduce bubbles in the
     | pipeline that ultimately cause fewer pipeline slots containing useful
     | work to be retired per cycle than the machine is capable to support. This
     | opportunity cost results in slower execution. Long-latency operations
     | like divides and memory operations can cause this, as can too many
     | operations being directed to a single execution port (for example, more
     | multiply operations arriving in the back-end per cycle than the execution
     | unit can support).
     |
        Memory Bound: 52.5% of Pipeline Slots
         | The metric value is high. This can indicate that the significant

         | memory load and stores. Use Memory Access analysis to have the metric
         | breakdown by memory hierarchy, memory bandwidth information,
         | correlation by memory objects.

            DRAM Bound: 51.0% of Clockticks
             | This metric shows how often CPU was stalled on the main memory
             | (DRAM). Caching typically improves the latency and increases
             | performance.

                Memory Bandwidth: 0.0% of Clockticks
                Memory Latency: 61.7% of Clockticks
                 | Issue: A significant fraction of cycles was stalled due to
                 | the latency of the main memory (DRAM).
                 | 
                 | Tips: Improve data accesses or interleave them with compute
                 | using such possible techniques as data layout re-structuring
                 | or software prefetches (through the compiler).

         | software's instructions are both categorized under Core Bound. Hence
         | it may indicate the machine ran out of an OOO resources, certain

         | instruction- flow are limiting the performance (e.g. FP-chained long-
