        Front-End Bandwidth: 14.7% of Pipeline Slots
         | This metric represents a fraction of slots during which CPU was
         | stalled due to front-end bandwidth issues, such as inefficiencies in
         | the instruction decoders or code restrictions for caching in the DSB
         | (decoded uOps cache). In such cases, the front-end typically delivers
         | a non-optimal amount of uOps to the back-end.
         |
            Front-End Bandwidth MITE: 2.2% of Pipeline Slots
             | This metric represents a fraction of cycles during which CPU was
             | stalled due to the MITE fetch pipeline issues, such as
             | inefficiencies in the instruction decoders.
             |
            Front-End Bandwidth DSB: 25.7% of Pipeline Slots
             | This metric represents a fraction of cycles during which CPU was
             | likely limited due to DSB (decoded uop cache) fetch pipeline. For
             | example, inefficient utilization of the DSB cache structure or
             | bank conflict when reading from it, are categorized here.

            (Info) DSB Coverage: 96.7%
    Bad Speculation: 26.1% of Pipeline Slots
     | A significant proportion of pipeline slots containing useful work are
     | being cancelled. This can be caused by mispredicting branches or by
     | machine clears. Note that this metric value may be highlighted due to
     | Branch Resteers issue.
     |
        Branch Mispredict: 26.1% of Pipeline Slots
         | Issue:: A significant proportion of branches are mispredicted,
         | leading to excessive wasted work or Backend stalls due to the machine
         | need to recover its state from a speculative path.
         | 
         | Tips:
         | 
         | 1. Identify heavily mispredicted branches and consider making your
         | algorithm more predictable or reducing the number of branches. You
         | can add more work to 'if' statements and move them higher in the code
         | flow for earlier execution. If using 'switch' or 'case' statements,
         | put the most commonly executed cases first. Avoid using virtual
         | function pointers for heavily executed calls.
         | 
         | 2. Use profile-guided optimization in the compiler.
         | 
         | See the Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Optimization Reference
         | Manual for general strategies to address branch misprediction issues.
