        Front-End Bandwidth: 11.4% of Pipeline Slots
         | This metric represents a fraction of slots during which CPU was
         | stalled due to front-end bandwidth issues, such as inefficiencies in
         | the instruction decoders or code restrictions for caching in the DSB
         | (decoded uOps cache). In such cases, the front-end typically delivers
         | a non-optimal amount of uOps to the back-end.

            Front-End Bandwidth MITE: 7.1% of Pipeline Slots
             | This metric represents a fraction of cycles during which CPU was

             | inefficiencies in the instruction decoders.

        Machine Clears: 6.9% of Pipeline Slots
    Back-End Bound: 48.6% of Pipeline Slots
     | A significant portion of pipeline slots are remaining empty. When
     | operations take too long in the back-end, they introduce bubbles in the
     | pipeline that ultimately cause fewer pipeline slots containing useful
     | work to be retired per cycle than the machine is capable to support. This
     | opportunity cost results in slower execution. Long-latency operations
     | like divides and memory operations can cause this, as can too many
     | operations being directed to a single execution port (for example, more
     | multiply operations arriving in the back-end per cycle than the execution
     | unit can support).

         | This metric represents how much Core non-memory issues were of a
         | bottleneck. Shortage in hardware compute resources, or dependencies
         | software's instructions are both categorized under Core Bound. Hence
         | it may indicate the machine ran out of an OOO resources, certain
         | execution units are overloaded or dependencies in program's data- or
         | instruction- flow are limiting the performance (e.g. FP-chained long-
         | latency arithmetic operations).
         |
            Divider: 0.0% of Clockticks
            Port Utilization: 50.2% of Clockticks
             | Issue: A significant fraction of cycles was stalled due to Core
             | non-divider-related issues.
             | 
             | Tips: Use vectorization to reduce pressure on the execution ports
             | as multiple elements are calculated with same uOp.
             |
                Cycles of 0 Ports Utilized: 41.9% of Clockticks
                 | CPU executed no uOps on any execution port during a
                 | significant fraction of cycles. Long-latency instructions
                 | like divides may contribute to this issue. Check the Assembly
                 | view and Appendix C in the Optimization Guide to identify
                 | instructions with 5 or more cycles latency.
                 |
                Cycles of 1 Port Utilized: 24.5% of Clockticks
                 | This metric represents cycles fraction where the CPU executed
                 | total of 1 uop per cycle on all execution ports. This can be
                 | due to heavy data-dependency among software instructions, or
                 | oversubscribing a particular hardware resource. In some other
                 | cases with high 1_Port_Utilized and L1 Bound, this metric can
                 | point to L1 data-cache latency bottleneck that may not
                 | necessarily manifest with complete execution starvation (due
                 | to the short L1 latency e.g. walking a linked list) - looking
                 | at the assembly can be helpful. Note that this metric value
                 | may be highlighted due to L1 Bound issue.
