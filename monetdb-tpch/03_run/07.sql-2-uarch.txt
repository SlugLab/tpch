        Front-End Bandwidth: 11.2% of Pipeline Slots
         | This metric represents a fraction of slots during which CPU was
         | stalled due to front-end bandwidth issues, such as inefficiencies in
         | the instruction decoders or code restrictions for caching in the DSB
         | (decoded uOps cache). In such cases, the front-end typically delivers
         | a non-optimal amount of uOps to the back-end.
         |
            Front-End Bandwidth MITE: 9.7% of Pipeline Slots
             | This metric represents a fraction of cycles during which CPU was
             | stalled due to the MITE fetch pipeline issues, such as
             | inefficiencies in the instruction decoders.
             |
            Front-End Bandwidth DSB: 15.8% of Pipeline Slots
             | This metric represents a fraction of cycles during which CPU was
             | likely limited due to DSB (decoded uop cache) fetch pipeline. For
             | example, inefficient utilization of the DSB cache structure or
             | bank conflict when reading from it, are categorized here.
             |
            (Info) DSB Coverage: 61.5%
             | Issue: A significant fraction of uOps was not delivered by the
             | DSB (known as Decoded ICache or uOp Cache). This may happen if a
             | hot code region is too large to fit into the DSB.
             | 
             | Tips: Consider changing the code layout (for example, via
             | profile-guided optimization) to help your hot regions fit into
             | the DSB.
             |

             | and IA-32 Architectures Optimization Reference Manual.

    Bad Speculation: 3.6% of Pipeline Slots
        Branch Mispredict: 3.6% of Pipeline Slots
        Machine Clears: 0.0% of Pipeline Slots
    Back-End Bound: 31.2% of Pipeline Slots
     | A significant portion of pipeline slots are remaining empty. When
     | operations take too long in the back-end, they introduce bubbles in the
     | pipeline that ultimately cause fewer pipeline slots containing useful
     | work to be retired per cycle than the machine is capable to support. This
     | opportunity cost results in slower execution. Long-latency operations
     | like divides and memory operations can cause this, as can too many
     | operations being directed to a single execution port (for example, more
     | multiply operations arriving in the back-end per cycle than the execution
     | unit can support).
     |
        Memory Bound: 22.2% of Pipeline Slots
         | The metric value is high. This can indicate that the significant
         | fraction of execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand
         | memory load and stores. Use Memory Access analysis to have the metric
         | breakdown by memory hierarchy, memory bandwidth information,
         | correlation by memory objects.
         |
            L1 Bound: 18.4% of Clockticks
             | This metric shows how often machine was stalled without missing
             | the L1 data cache. The L1 cache typically has the shortest
             | latency. However, in certain cases like loads blocked on older
             | stores, a load might suffer a high latency even though it is
             | being satisfied by the L1. Note that this metric value may be
             | highlighted due to DTLB Overhead or Cycles of 1 Port Utilized
             | issues.
             |
                DTLB Overhead: 0.0% of Clockticks
                Loads Blocked by Store Forwarding: 0.0% of Clockticks
                Lock Latency: 0.0% of Clockticks
                 | A significant fraction of CPU cycles spent handling cache
                 | misses due to lock operations. Due to the microarchitecture
                 | handling of locks, they are classified as L1 Bound regardless
                 | of what memory source satisfied them. Note that this metric
                 | value may be highlighted due to Store Latency issue.
                 |
                Split Loads: 0.0% of Clockticks
                4K Aliasing: 0.2% of Clockticks
                FB Full: 0.0% of Clockticks
                 | This metric does a rough estimation of how often L1D Fill
                 | Buffer unavailability limited additional L1D miss memory
                 | access requests to proceed. The higher the metric value, the
                 | deeper the memory hierarchy level the misses are satisfied
                 | from. Often it hints on approaching bandwidth limits (to L2
                 | cache, L3 cache or external memory). Avoid adding software
                 | prefetches if indeed memory BW limited.
                 |
            L2 Bound: 15.3% of Clockticks
             | This metric shows how often machine was stalled on L2 cache.
             | Avoiding cache misses (L1 misses/L2 hits) will improve the
             | latency and increase performance.
