     | A significant portion of pipeline slots are remaining empty. When

     | work to be retired per cycle than the machine is capable to support. This
     | opportunity cost results in slower execution. Long-latency operations
     | like divides and memory operations can cause this, as can too many
     | operations being directed to a single execution port (for example, more
     | multiply operations arriving in the back-end per cycle than the execution
     | unit can support).

         | software's instructions are both categorized under Core Bound. Hence
         | it may indicate the machine ran out of an OOO resources, certain
         | execution units are overloaded or dependencies in program's data- or

             | Issue: A significant fraction of cycles was stalled due to Core

             | 
             | Tips: Use vectorization to reduce pressure on the execution ports
