    Retiring: 22.4% of Pipeline Slots

        Heavy Operations: 5.2% of Pipeline Slots
            Microcode Sequencer: 5.2% of Pipeline Slots
                Assists: 0.0% of Pipeline Slots
                CISC: 5.2% of Pipeline Slots
    Front-End Bound: 18.5% of Pipeline Slots
     | Issue: A significant portion of Pipeline Slots is remaining empty due to
     | issues in the Front-End.
     | 
     | Tips:  Make sure the code working size is not too large, the code layout
     | does not require too many memory accesses per cycle to get enough
     | instructions for filling four pipeline slots, or check for microcode
     | assists.
     |
        Front-End Latency: 13.2% of Pipeline Slots
         | This metric represents a fraction of slots during which CPU was
         | stalled due to front-end latency issues, such as instruction-cache
         | misses, ITLB misses or fetch stalls after a branch misprediction. In
         | such cases, the front-end delivers no uOps.

            ICache Misses: 2.0% of Clockticks
            ITLB Overhead: 1.4% of Clockticks
            Branch Resteers: 3.3% of Clockticks

            Length Changing Prefixes: 0.0% of Clockticks
            MS Switches: 2.4% of Clockticks
             | Issue: A significant fraction of cycles was stalled due to
             | switches of uOp delivery to the Microcode Sequencer (MS).
             | Commonly used instructions are optimized for delivery by the DSB
             | or MITE pipelines. Certain operations cannot be handled natively
             | by the execution pipeline, and must be performed by microcode
             | (small programs injected into the execution stream). Switching to
             | the MS too often can negatively impact performance. The MS is
             | designated to deliver long uOp flows required by CISC
             | instructions like CPUID, or uncommon conditions like Floating
             | Point Assists when dealing with Denormals. Note that this metric
             | value may be highlighted due to Microcode Sequencer issue.

        Branch Mispredict: 4.7% of Pipeline Slots
        Machine Clears: 1.2% of Pipeline Slots
    Back-End Bound: 53.2% of Pipeline Slots
     | A significant portion of pipeline slots are remaining empty. When
     | operations take too long in the back-end, they introduce bubbles in the
     | pipeline that ultimately cause fewer pipeline slots containing useful
     | work to be retired per cycle than the machine is capable to support. This
     | opportunity cost results in slower execution. Long-latency operations
     | like divides and memory operations can cause this, as can too many
     | operations being directed to a single execution port (for example, more
     | multiply operations arriving in the back-end per cycle than the execution
     | unit can support).
     |
        Memory Bound: 34.5% of Pipeline Slots
         | The metric value is high. This can indicate that the significant
         | fraction of execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand
         | memory load and stores. Use Memory Access analysis to have the metric
         | breakdown by memory hierarchy, memory bandwidth information,
         | correlation by memory objects.
         |
            L1 Bound: 15.7% of Clockticks
             | This metric shows how often machine was stalled without missing
             | the L1 data cache. The L1 cache typically has the shortest
             | latency. However, in certain cases like loads blocked on older
             | stores, a load might suffer a high latency even though it is
             | being satisfied by the L1. Note that this metric value may be
             | highlighted due to DTLB Overhead or Cycles of 1 Port Utilized
             | issues.
             |
                DTLB Overhead: 2.3% of Clockticks
                Loads Blocked by Store Forwarding: 0.9% of Clockticks
                Lock Latency: 0.0% of Clockticks
                 | A significant fraction of CPU cycles spent handling cache
                 | misses due to lock operations. Due to the microarchitecture
                 | handling of locks, they are classified as L1 Bound regardless
                 | of what memory source satisfied them. Note that this metric
                 | value may be highlighted due to Store Latency issue.
                 |
                Split Loads: 0.0% of Clockticks
                4K Aliasing: 0.2% of Clockticks
                FB Full: 0.0% of Clockticks
                 | This metric does a rough estimation of how often L1D Fill
                 | Buffer unavailability limited additional L1D miss memory
                 | access requests to proceed. The higher the metric value, the
                 | deeper the memory hierarchy level the misses are satisfied
                 | from. Often it hints on approaching bandwidth limits (to L2
                 | cache, L3 cache or external memory). Avoid adding software
                 | prefetches if indeed memory BW limited.

        Core Bound: 18.8% of Pipeline Slots
         | This metric represents how much Core non-memory issues were of a
         | bottleneck. Shortage in hardware compute resources, or dependencies
         | software's instructions are both categorized under Core Bound. Hence
         | it may indicate the machine ran out of an OOO resources, certain
         | execution units are overloaded or dependencies in program's data- or
         | instruction- flow are limiting the performance (e.g. FP-chained long-
         | latency arithmetic operations).
